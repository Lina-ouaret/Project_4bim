### General Info
***
First version of our project : "Portraits robot".
The main objective of the project is to create a software module that proposes a series of portraits with close facial traits to a criminal/assaulter to help witnesses narrow down the assaultersâ€™ physical characteristics, facilitating the recognition of possible assaulters.
This assisted identification of a presumably criminal person by a witness is based upon a database of identity pictures (olivetti database) and a method, composed by a neural network and a genetic algorithm, allowing creating synthetic pictures from it to get the closest image of the searched individual.
